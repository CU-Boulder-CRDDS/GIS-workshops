## JupyterHub Setup:  
*Very easy!*

### Step 1: Log in:
I will create your username in the session, and you'll set your password the first time you log in.  

**Go to the following link:**   
__[https://jupyter-crdds.rc.colorado.edu/](https://jupyter-crdds.rc.colorado.edu/)__
This will only be available through this week, but all workshop materials are available on GitHub for later use.  

![HubLogin][LogIn]  


*You will set your password the first time you log in, so type in anything you want here.*

Your home page will look like this:   

![HomePage][HubHome]

### Step 2: Import Workshop Notebooks

__Go to the following link: [bit.ly/geopdnotebooks](http://bit.ly/geopdnotebooks)__

Now, refresh your JupyterHub homepage. This will add all of the workshop notebooks to your JupyterHub. It should now look like this:  

![NotebooksAdded][HubHome2]

*Done! I told you it was easy!*
